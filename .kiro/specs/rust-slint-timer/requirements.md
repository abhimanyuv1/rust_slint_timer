# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a desktop timer application built with Rust and Slint UI framework. The timer will provide basic countdown functionality with a clean, intuitive user interface that allows users to set custom time durations, start/stop the timer, and receive visual feedback when the timer completes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set a custom timer duration, so that I can track specific time intervals for my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display input fields for hours, minutes, and seconds
2. WHEN I enter valid time values (0-23 hours, 0-59 minutes, 0-59 seconds) THEN the system SHALL accept and store these values
3. IF I enter invalid time values THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent timer start
4. WHEN I clear the input fields THEN the system SHALL reset to default values (00:00:00)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start and stop the timer, so that I can control when the countdown begins and pauses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the start button with valid time set THEN the system SHALL begin countdown and change button to "Pause"
2. WHEN the timer is running and I click pause THEN the system SHALL pause the countdown and change button to "Resume"
3. WHEN the timer is paused and I click resume THEN the system SHALL continue countdown from where it left off
4. WHEN I click reset button THEN the system SHALL stop the timer and restore the original time values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the timer countdown in real-time, so that I can monitor the remaining time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL update the display every second showing remaining time
2. WHEN the timer reaches zero THEN the system SHALL display "00:00:00" and stop the countdown
3. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL display time in HH:MM:SS format
4. WHEN the timer completes THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication (color change or notification)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be notified when the timer completes, so that I know my time interval has finished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timer reaches zero THEN the system SHALL display a completion message
2. WHEN the timer completes THEN the system SHALL change the visual appearance to indicate completion
3. WHEN the timer completes THEN the system SHALL reset the start button to initial state
4. WHEN the timer completes THEN the system SHALL allow me to set a new timer immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a clean and responsive interface, so that it's easy to use and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a centered, well-organized layout
2. WHEN I interact with buttons THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN I resize the window THEN the system SHALL maintain proper layout proportions
4. WHEN elements are focused THEN the system SHALL show clear focus indicators for accessibility
